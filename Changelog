* collision detection with trucks (check all based on distance)
* collision detection with terrain (gets start and end pos of current segment,
and interpolates based on player pos along this. works out wall and cliff drop
x as x = start_pos + gradient * factor +- 1.0 for each side. then checks vs
player x)
* finish level check (is player z < -800)
* fullscreen mode and -res command line params
* hidden mouse cursor
* crash = stop player for 3s and then reposition on road
also immune for 2s after that to prevent insta-death
* smashed windscreen when crashed
* bigger dash

13 Nov 2014
* added gamepad/joystick detection and controls for xbox 360 controller

10 Nov 2014
* added text rendering for level timer

2 Nov 2014
* steering wheel
* moved mirror along a bit
* added left and right curves randomly to road sections
* fixed dash camera so doesnt actually move with car

31 Oct 2014
* added sounds with irrklang (only linux64 atm)
* pitch shifting of sounds with speed
* change focal length of perspective matrix with speed
* failed attempt at post-processing motion blur

30 Oct 2014
* truck model and truck loader/updater/drawer code
* moving wheels for the trucks (trucks don't drive yet though)
* rear-vision mirror
* moving truck traffic!
* emission-mapped truck headlights

23 Oct 2014 - anton
* entire level's worth of road lengths are generated in a loop and all are
drawn at once (no optimisation yet)

22 Oct 2014 - anton
* added callback with GLFW to handle updating perspective matrix when window is
resized
* added player.c/.h to handle keyboard input etc.
* basic driving controls
* fixed terrain gen so that it's -1 to 1 instead of 0 to 1 on x

16 Oct 2014 - anton
* first commit, project only a plan at this stage
* added slight randomness to X for each segment so that there are no
completely straight road bits - for interesting to look at
* add cliffs to an additional VAO. they join to the side of the road, but i
render separately b/c want a different shader
* cliffs purple shader with screen-space cross-hatching reproduced. scaled-up
for higher-res display. gl_FragCoord.xy to get on-screen position of fragments,
then even/odd to determine if black dot or purple
* added distance fade-to-dark for shaders using gl_FragCoord.w
* added gamma correction to shaders

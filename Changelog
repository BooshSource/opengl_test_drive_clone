* first commit, project only a plan at this stage
* added slight randomness to X for each segment so that there are no
completely straight road bits - for interesting to look at
* add cliffs to an additional VAO. they join to the side of the road, but i
render separately b/c want a different shader
* cliffs purple shader with screen-space cross-hatching reproduced. scaled-up
for higher-res display. gl_FragCoord.xy to get on-screen position of fragments,
then even/odd to determine if black dot or purple
* added distance fade-to-dark for shaders using gl_FragCoord.w
* added gamma correction to shaders

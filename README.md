This is an OpenGL 4 remake of the CGA-version of 1987 IBM-Compatible game:

=================================>TEST DRIVE

My Computer Graphics students have to do a `game project' assignment, so I
thought I'd do it too. I'll start a bit ahead of time because I think it's neat
to see /how/ something like this can be made.

I chose Test Drive because it has some interesting elements in 2d and 3d, and
bizarre colouring. I was also thinking of Battlezone for the Atari 2600, but
there's plenty of remakes of that already.
